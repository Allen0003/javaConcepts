Look at this code that calculates and displays the area of a rectangle:

int area = width * lenght;
Console.WriteLine("area = " + area);

This is totally dependent on a rectangle shape, and we are aware of the implementation details. 
I wonâ€™t dive into the details of bad design here, but it could be redesigned as follows:

int area = shape.GetArea();
Console.WriteLine("area = " + area);

We are no longer aware of the implementation details and only have to deal with the shape interface, which could be a rectangle or circle. Polymorphism is going on here.
